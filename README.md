# Data Structures & Algorithms in C++

A comprehensive collection of data structures and algorithms implemented from scratch in C++. This repository serves as both a learning journey and a reference implementation, documenting the theoretical foundations and practical implementations of fundamental computer science concepts.

## Purpose

This repository is designed to:

- **Learn**: Build deep understanding through hands-on implementation
- **Share**: Provide clear, well-documented code for others learning DSA
- **Showcase**: Demonstrate proficiency in C++, memory management, and algorithmic thinking

## Implementation Progress

### Linear Data Structures

| Data Structure | Status         | Description                                                                                                                                                  | Documentation                |
| -------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| **Array ADT**  | 🚧 In Progress | A dynamic array implementation with fixed capacity, supporting basic operations like append and display. Demonstrates memory management and RAII principles. | [View Docs](Array/README.md) |

## Legend

- ✅ **Completed**: Fully implemented with comprehensive documentation
- 🚧 **In Progress**: Currently being developed and enhanced
- 📝 **Planned**: Scheduled for future implementation
